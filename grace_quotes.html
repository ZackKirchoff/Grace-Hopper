		<h2>Quotes to Live by</h2>
		<blockquote>
		<p>
		“it is easier to ask forgiveness than it is to get permission”
		</p>
		<p>
		“[the computer] was the first machine man built that assisted 
		the power of his brain instead of the strength of his arm”
		</p>
		<p>
		“The most important thing I've accomplished, other than building 
		the compiler, is training young people. They come to me, you know, 
		and say, 'Do you think we can do this?' I say, "Try it." And 
		I back 'em up. They need that. I keep track of them as they 
		get older and I stir 'em up at intervals so they don't 
		forget to take chances.“
