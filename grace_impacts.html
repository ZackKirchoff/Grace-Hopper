			<h2>The lasting Impact of Grandma COBOL</h2>
			<p>
			Hopper's advancements toward better programming languages helped steer the way 
			towards the computer science that we know today. With programming languages becoming 
			higher level came with it the ability for people without degrees in mathmatics to write
			code that a computer could understand. This led the way for even more advanced languages
			to be developed and without those I would not even be able to make this webpage that you 
			are viewing.

			<p>
			It would not be an exageration to say that the current state of computing is all thanks to 
			people like grace hopper and their enormous efforts to iron out the "bugs" of early computing.
