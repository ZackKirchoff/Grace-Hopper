			<h2>Grace Hopper's Life</h2>
			<p>
			She was born in New York city in 1906 and even as a child was very curious a
			bout how things worked; when she was 7 years old she had dismantled 7 alarm clocks
			in an effort to figure out how they worked before her mother had realized what she 
			was doing and limited her to one clock. This hunger for knowledge led her to get early 
			admission to college at age 17 and later her graduation with a PhD in mathematics from 
			Yale in 1934. From there she went on to continue as an associate professor of 
			mathematics at Vassar.
			</p>
			<p>
			During World War 2 however Hopper attempted to join the Navy but was denied on account
			of her age, which at the time was 34 too old to be on active duty, as well as her job 
			being a benefit to the war effort. She, however, would not let that stop her form 
			enlisting at all and went on to join the Navy Reserve in 1943. From here the Navy 
			assigned her to work on the Bureau of Ships computation project at Harvard university.
			Where she was part of her first major project involving computing.
			</p>
			<p>
			Grace Hopper was assigned to the Harvard Mark 1 computer programming staff and had 
			coauthored with Howard Aiken 3 papers on the Mark 1. This however was only her 
			introduction into computing as she then went on to join the team working on the 
			UNIVAC 1, the first commercial computer produced in the united states. During this 
			time Hopper's team was said to have found the “first computer bug” which was a 
			literal moth that had found its way into a relay of the Mark II computer. It was 
			here that Hopper recommending developing a new programming language that would 
			use entirely English words; however, at the time she "was told very quickly 
			that [she] couldn't do this because computers didn't understand English."
			</p>
			<p>
			Hopper however wouldn't be dissuaded and went on to develop her first compiler 
			which was simply known as the A-compiler in 1952. This compiler made it much 
			easier to use a computer because you didn't need to have the knowledge of how 
			to write their instructions in machine code. This development went on to later 
			be used as the foundations for some of the first compilers including MATH-MATIC 
			and FLOW-MATIC. Which later at a 2-day confrence known as CODASYL, which Hopper 
			was consulting at, was extended with some ideas taken from the IBM equivalent 
			COMTRAN and turned into COBOL( COmmon Business-Oriented Language) which became 
			the most ubiquitous programming language to date.
