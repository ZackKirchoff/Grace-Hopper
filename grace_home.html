			Admiral Grace Hopper was a Imprtant figure in the field of computer science.
			Her contributions led to the development of many english-based programming languages including 
			COBOL which was one of the first wide spread programming languages based around using 
			everyday language.
			</p>
			<p>
			Though modern programming has taken the concept of a English-based language for granted, in the early days
			computer programming computers could only understand machine code and it 
			was considered impossible to make a computer understand everyday language.
			this made it so that even after she made her first prototype many people
			wouldn't use it because they assumed it wouldn't work.

			“i had a running compiler and nobody would touch it... 
			they carefully told me, computers could only do arithmetic; they could not do programs.”
